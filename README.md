# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch: A digital version of the classic toy, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can draw on a grid-based canvas, adjust grid size, and reset the canvas. This project showcases DOM manipulation, interactive design, and user-friendly features, providing a fun and nostalgic drawing experience.

## Techniques and Methods Used

### 1. **HTML for Structure**
   - Creating a grid-based canvas for drawing.
   - Buttons and input elements for user interaction (e.g., reset, adjust grid size).

### 2. **CSS for Styling**
   - Styling the canvas and controls for a clean, user-friendly interface.
   - Hover effects for interactive grid cells.
   - Responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.

### 3. **JavaScript for Interactivity**
   - DOM manipulation to dynamically create and manage grid cells.
   - Event listeners to capture user actions like mouse hover and clicks.
   - Logic to handle drawing, resetting, and resizing the grid.

### 4. **Flexbox/Grid Layouts**
   - Using CSS Flexbox or Grid for aligning and structuring the application layout.

### 5. **Dynamic Grid Generation**
   - JavaScript functions to create grids of varying sizes based on user input.
   - Handling edge cases like extremely small or large grid sizes.

### 6. **Event Handling**
   - Capturing and responding to mouse events for drawing.
   - Adding keyboard shortcuts for enhanced usability.

### 7. **Code Optimization**
   - Writing modular and reusable functions.
   - Minimizing redundant code for better performance and readability.

### 8. **Version Control with Git**
   - Tracking changes and maintaining project versions.

This project is a great opportunity to showcase fundamental web development skills and creativity while engaging users with an interactive application.
